# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile


# The configuration below serves a welcome page over HTTP on port 80.  To use
# your own domain name with automatic HTTPS, ensure your A/AAAA DNS record is
# pointing to this machine's public IP, then replace `http://` with your domain
# name.  Refer to the documentation for full instructions on the address
# specification.
#
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/concepts#addresses
 http:// {
    
    # php_fastcgi unix//run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock
    # root  * /usr/share/phpMyAdmin
    

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /usr/share/caddy

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
    # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    php_fastcgi localhost:9000
       

    # Refer to the directive documentation for more options.
    # https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives
